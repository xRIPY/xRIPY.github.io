You found the legacy link!
I made this when I was in school.
Convertor is my first ever JS program.
The 3D one was actualy done by my brother, i only implemented it in JS canvas.
A second of silence for all my programs I lost with the school deleting my google drive.
I may or may not have made them to cheat on some tests :3
